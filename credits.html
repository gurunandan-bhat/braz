                        <p>
                            Born in Lisbon, Portugal, Maria deep-rroted love for her hometown, coexists harmoniously with her passion for globetrotting,
                            ensuring she is never tethered to one place for too long. Growing up as the daughter of two artists - her father is a renowned Art
                            Director in cinema and advertising, and her mother with a background in Executive Production – Maria was immersed in a world of
                            artistic inspiration from an early age. The eclectic exposure to music, literature, and cinema shaped Maria’s upbringing, fostering
                            a shared artistic inclination among her four siblings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maria's early years led her down a path of exploration, initially delving into her skills as a designer and scenographer. She
                            pursued Graphic Design at the Art School in Lisbon and later embarked on a Film & Scenography degree at Aberystwyth University, in
                            Wales. Simultaneously, she found her voice in choirs, developing a profound appreciation for choral music, eventually prompting her
                            to shift her focus to Music at 19.

                            Música de Lisboa, along with completing a Classical Singing course at Lisbon Conservatory of Music. As a professional choir singer,
                            she has collaborated with esteemed groups like Coro de Câmara Lisboa Cantat, and Ensemble Vocal Desafinados. Working with
                            distinguished conductors such as Paulo Lourenço, Artur Carneiro, Vasco Pearce de Azevedo, Theodor Guschlbauer, Santiago Lusardi and

                            Since 2012, she has been a member of the Ricercare Choir and works regularly with maestro Pedro Teixeira. It features collaborations
                            with renowned artists and musical groups in Portugal and internationally, such as Mariza, Camané, José Cura, Andrea Bocelli or
                            world-famous band The Rolling Stones.

                        <p>
                            She has performed as a solo soprano in countries such as Tunisia, India, Hungary and Portugal. Recently, she was resident soprano
                            and assistant conductor of the Goa University Choir and the Stuti Choral Ensemble, both based in Goa, led by maestros Santiago

                            Currently on the verge of completing her degree at the prestigious Hot Club Jazz School in Lisbon, Maria has not only honed her
                            skills as a performer but has also been invited to teach at the school since 2023. Her multifaceted musical journey reflects a
                            continuous commitment to artistic exploration and community engagement.

                            A rolling stone. That could sum up Gasper's career projectile. But while other stones gather all the moss, Gasper has been out
                            learning new tricks, seeking new adventures, and moving boundaries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the core, Gasper has always loved storytelling, ever since he first wrote short stories for the school magazine. At the turn of
                            the millennium, Gasper joined an English daily to head the web edition. Over the course of his 7-year newspaper stint, he coded the
                            website, redesigned the newspaper, wrote features for the Sunday edition and produced photo-documentaries for print and web
                            editions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, in 2007, at the start of the DSLR revolution, he decided to test the waters in video. Soon, he was shooting and producing
                            video features from across India for France-based Euronews Television. He felt just as much at home in rural India as in corporate
                            boardrooms, telling untold stories of development, education and healthcare in an India that was seeing rapid growth and change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working with other filmmakers as editor, Gasper soon realised he loved finding connections and helping bring more stories to life.
                            In the dark confines of the edit suite, he found new adventures, pursuing through hours of rushes and building sequences. So, he
                            turned his attention to documentary film editing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, he has set up a boutique post-production studio in his hometown on the coast of Goa, where he quietly helps directors bring
                            visions to the screen. The rolling stone continues to roll, and each day brings new interests to pursue and adventures to seek.

                            Tanya Távora’s journey into film production has been shaped by a blend of journalistic zeal and creative storytelling. After earning
                            a degree in Mass Communication from St. Xavier’s College in Goa, Tanya cultivated an early interest in media that seamlessly
                            integrated writing, editing, and the art of storytelling. During her time in college, she became increasingly drawn to the
                            behind-the-scenes aspects of media production, marking the start of her transition into filmmaking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Writing for a global journalism society, helped sharpen her storytelling abilities and allowed her to explore diverse narratives on
                            a global scale. Her internship at O Heraldo Newspaper in Goa played a pivotal role in refining her writing. These formative
                            experiences laid the foundation for building both her technical skills and keen editorial eye.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tanya’s true passion for production emerged during her college years, and it wasn’t long before she pivoted toward filmmaking. This
                            led her to Lotus Film &amp; TV Production, where Tanya currently works as an editor. At Lotus Film, she has been integral to the
                            production of Hora dos Portugueses, a compelling television program about Portuguese living in India, airing on RTPi (International
                            Portuguese television). Over the course of 10 episodes, Tanya played a pivotal role in filming, editing and shaping the final
                            product, working closely with the director to bring the vision to life with precision.
