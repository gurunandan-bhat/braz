						<div class="display-6 open-sans pb-4">Musical Director</div>
						<p>
							Born in Lisbon, Portugal, Maria deep-rroted love for her hometown, coexists harmoniously with her passion for globetrotting,
							ensuring she is never tethered to one place for too long. Growing up as the daughter of two artists - her father is a renowned Art
							Director in cinema and advertising, and her mother with a background in Executive Production – Maria was immersed in a world of
							artistic inspiration from an early age. The eclectic exposure to music, literature, and cinema shaped Maria’s upbringing, fostering
							a shared artistic inclination among her four siblings.
						</p>
						<p>
							Maria's early years led her down a path of exploration, initially delving into her skills as a designer and scenographer. She
							pursued Graphic Design at the Art School in Lisbon and later embarked on a Film & Scenography degree at Aberystwyth University, in
							Wales. Simultaneously, she found her voice in choirs, developing a profound appreciation for choral music, eventually prompting her
							to shift her focus to Music at 19.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overcoming challenges, Maria holds degrees in Music in the Community and Choral Conducting/Musical Training, from Escola Superior de
							Música de Lisboa, along with completing a Classical Singing course at Lisbon Conservatory of Music. As a professional choir singer,
							she has collaborated with esteemed groups like Coro de Câmara Lisboa Cantat, and Ensemble Vocal Desafinados. Working with
							distinguished conductors such as Paulo Lourenço, Artur Carneiro, Vasco Pearce de Azevedo, Theodor Guschlbauer, Santiago Lusardi and
							Zane Dalal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since 2012, she has been a member of the Ricercare Choir and works regularly with maestro Pedro Teixeira. It features collaborations
							with renowned artists and musical groups in Portugal and internationally, such as Mariza, Camané, José Cura, Andrea Bocelli or
							world-famous band The Rolling Stones.
						</p>
						<p>
							She has performed as a solo soprano in countries such as Tunisia, India, Hungary and Portugal. Recently, she was resident soprano
							and assistant conductor of the Goa University Choir and the Stuti Choral Ensemble, both based in Goa, led by maestros Santiago
							Lusardi Girelli and Parvesh Java, respectively.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently on the verge of completing her degree at the prestigious Hot Club Jazz School in Lisbon, Maria has not only honed her
							skills as a performer but has also been invited to teach at the school since 2023. Her multifaceted musical journey reflects a
							continuous commitment to artistic exploration and community engagement.

							Rui Simões (Lisbon, 1944) studied Film and Television Directing at the Institut des Arts de Diffusion in Brussels. He returned to
							Portugal in 1974, starting his film career by producing and directing two documentaries about the post-revolutionary period: "Deus,

						<div class="display-6 open-sans pb-4">Associate Producer</div>
						<p>
							Sigrid Pfeffer worked for 35 years as a sound technician at the radio station Hessischer Rundfunk in Frankfurt. In the early 1990s,
							she also alternated with radio DJ and music journalist Klaus Walter in selecting the music for the &quot;Radio Unfrisiert&quot;
							program on hr2-Kultur, the cultural channel of Hessischer Rundfunk.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the mid-1990s, she discovered the music of the so-called &quot;Asian Underground,&quot; a fusion of South Asian rhythms and
							harmonies with Western electronic dance music. Under the alias DJ Chai FX, she and DJ Eastenders hosted the club night &quot;New
							Asian Dance Music&quot; in Frankfurt. Since 1997, she has traveled to India almost every year.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2001, she fell in love with the Goan cantaram. In 2009, she released the album Konkani Songs/Music from Goa - Made in Bombay
							through Trikont/Munich, and in 2008, she produced a feature on the topic for the series &quot;Music of the World&quot; on
							hr2-Kultur. In 2015, she co-curated the &quot;Mother India&quot; festival at the House of Cultures of the World in Berlin.
						</p>
						<p>
							She has created several other programs on Indian music, including Blue Notes of Bombay on the early history of jazz in India, India
							Obscura on unique musical discoveries from India, India Indie on the independent music scene in India, Ladies Compartment about
							women in the Indian music industry, and, in 2023, a one-hour feature on India and the Beatles for the radio station WDR in Cologne.

						<p>
							Tanya Távora’s journey into film production has been shaped by a blend of journalistic zeal and creative storytelling. After earning
							a degree in Mass Communication from St. Xavier’s College in Goa, Tanya cultivated an early interest in media that seamlessly
							integrated writing, editing, and the art of storytelling. During her time in college, she became increasingly drawn to the
							behind-the-scenes aspects of media production, marking the start of her transition into filmmaking.
						</p>
						<p>
							Writing for a global journalism society, helped sharpen her storytelling abilities and allowed her to explore diverse narratives on
							a global scale. Her internship at O Heraldo Newspaper in Goa played a pivotal role in refining her writing. These formative
							experiences laid the foundation for building both her technical skills and keen editorial eye.
						</p>
						<p>
							Tanya’s true passion for production emerged during her college years, and it wasn’t long before she pivoted toward filmmaking. This
							led her to Lotus Film &amp; TV Production, where Tanya currently works as an editor. At Lotus Film, she has been integral to the
							production of Hora dos Portugueses, a compelling television program about Portuguese living in India, airing on RTPi (International
							Portuguese television). Over the course of 10 episodes, Tanya played a pivotal role in filming, editing and shaping the final
							product, working closely with the director to bring the vision to life with precision.
